## Vault Philosophy
- Flat vault approach: notes in root, folders only for admin (Calendar, Map, Attachments, Templates, Downloads)
- No deep folder hierarchies. Links and naming conventions do the organizational work
- CLAUDE.md is the source of truth for vault conventions. MEMORY.md is for things AI learns over time.

## Linking Priority
- **This is the #1 habit to maintain.** Every time content is added (meeting summaries, notes, updates), actively search the vault for real connections before writing
- Link to existing notes, Basecamps, and past discussions on first mention
- Update existing notes when new info adds meaningful context (not trivial status mentions)
- Don't force connections. Only link where it genuinely adds understanding or navigation value

## Daily Note Conventions
- **Never write to the Recap section automatically.** Only create/update the Recap when explicitly asked.
- When told to add something to the daily note, add it under Work or Personal in the Body section.
- The Recap is a separate, intentional end-of-day summary. Don't touch it unless asked.
- **Proactively offer to update the daily note after significant work.** After processing meeting transcripts, creating notes, or completing a substantial block of work, ask if anything should be captured in the daily note. Don't just move on silently.

## Daily Recap Style
- **TL;DR bullets, not narrative.** Headline + one sentence of context. Not paragraphs.
- **Anchor links to detail.** End bullets with `See [[#Heading]]` so full context is one click away.
- **Lead with what matters most,** not chronological order.
- **Don't repeat TODOs.** Recap = what happened, not what's pending.
- **Example:** `- Kit Collections beta pushed to March. Deliberate trade for UI work. See [[#Kit Collections]]`

## TODO Filtering
- **Not every action item from a meeting belongs on the TODO list.** Be selective.
- Only extract if: you own the action, you're the bottleneck, you need to chase someone you manage, or you're accountable if it drops.
- Other teams' internal work stays off the list. Visibility in the meeting is enough.
- The "Check:" prefix should be reserved for people you actually manage or coordinate with directly. Don't overuse it.

## Vault Research Discipline
- **Report what's actually in the vault.** Don't cross-pollinate answers from unrelated projects to fill gaps. A clear "the vault doesn't have this" is the correct answer when the information doesn't exist.
- **Search thoroughly before concluding the vault doesn't have the answer.** Check the relevant Basecamp, related notes, daily notes where the topic was discussed. Don't stop at the first near-miss result.
- Both rules matter equally: don't fabricate answers, but also don't give up too early.

## Meeting Transcript Processing
- **Speaker identification first, always.** Before writing a summary, present the speaker mapping for review. Use vault context (participant lists, roles, speech patterns) to identify speakers. Format as: `Speaker 1 = Name — [reasoning]`. Get sign-off before proceeding.
- **Topic extraction.** Break the transcript into discrete topics. Each becomes its own subsection with relevant tags and links.
- **Full meeting summary.** Written in the daily note body: reverse chronological, each topic as a `####` subsection under the meeting header (`###`). Include context links, what was discussed, what was decided, what's waiting.
- **TODO extraction.** Apply the TODO filtering rules. Only items you own, are bottleneck for, or need to chase.
- **Vault connections.** Link to existing notes. Update knowledge notes when meetings surface real new information.

**Common transcript issues to watch for:**
- Speaker labels are often generic (Speaker 1, Speaker 2). Never real names. Always need identification.
- Transcription tools sometimes hallucinate text during silence ("Thank you for watching!", repeated word loops)
- One person can get split across multiple speaker labels
- Quick utterances ("yeah," "right") are often misattributed
- Names get mangled. Check the People section in CLAUDE.md for correct spellings.

## Session Handoff
- After deep working sessions (transcript processing, note creation, problem-solving), proactively offer to update:
  1. The daily note with what was accomplished
  2. Relevant knowledge notes with conclusions or decisions
  3. Any Basecamps that should reflect new information
- Don't wait to be asked. The nudge should be specific ("want me to update the project Basecamp with what we just figured out?"), not generic ("want me to save anything?").
