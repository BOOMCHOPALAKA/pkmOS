## Imagine a World...

...where you had a personal Wikipedia for your life. Work, side projects, health, finances, travel, adventures, recipes. All of it connected, searchable, and growing every day. Fully interactive and conversational. You ask it questions and it answers with the full weight of everything you've ever put into it. If you can make a folder on your computer and type a message to AI, you're already there. 

That's noteOS.

**It remembers what you don't.** You had a conversation with your doctor three months ago. Or a contractor gave you a quote. Or you made a decision in a meeting and can't remember the reasoning. Instead of digging through emails or hoping you wrote it down somewhere, you ask. The system traces through your notes and gives you the answer with full context. Not because you organized everything perfectly. Because the system did.

**Things start connecting themselves.** You're planning a ski trip to the Alps and you're reminded of a hotel your friend raved about two years ago in a completely different conversation. You're experimenting with a new recipe and it connects back to a cooking class you took on vacation. Your life is full of these threads. The system finds them for you.

**It builds itself while you use it.** I thought I'd spend hours setting up folders and organizing notes. I didn't. I just type. I tell it what happened in a meeting, what I'm thinking about, what I need to remember. It creates the notes, links them to everything related, and the structure emerges on its own. Everything connects through links and references, like Wikipedia. You find things by following connections, not by remembering which folder you put something in.

The whole thing runs on plain text files and a free app. No code. No databases. You don't need to be technical. The system does the heavy lifting.

## What This Actually Is

You're probably already using AI. ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, whatever. Maybe you've had it help draft an email, summarize a meeting, explain something complicated, or brainstorm an idea. Maybe you've even set up projects or custom instructions, and the memory features mean it remembers some things between conversations.

But there's a ceiling. The memory is shallow. A few saved facts, some conversation history. You still end up re-explaining context, pasting things in, managing what it knows and doesn't know. It's like having a really smart coworker who remembers your name and your title but nothing about what happened in last week's meetings. And when you ask "where did you get that?" the answer is vague. "Based on our previous conversations." You're trusting the AI's summary of its own reasoning with no easy way to check.

This system removes that ceiling. Instead of AI that remembers fragments, you get AI that searches through a structured knowledge base of everything you've built. Your projects, your people, your decisions, your preferences. All of it lives in files you control on your computer. Plain text. Nothing proprietary. The AI reads those files, works inside them, and gets more helpful the more you add.

Think of it this way. If you had the world's best personal assistant, their value wouldn't just be their skills. It would be the six months they spent learning how you work, what you care about, and what's going on in your life. If they quit, all of that walks out the door. This system is like writing all of that down so the next assistant, or AI, can pick it up on day one. The intelligence is in the structure, not the tool.

## How It Works: 
### Folders & Files + Obsidian + AI = Your Personal Operating System

Before you download anything, here's what you're building and why it's structured the way it is. Three things work together:

1. **A main folder of subfolders and plain text files** that holds all your knowledge. This is where all the content you create will live and where we point the AI to work in and supercharge it.
2. **Obsidian**, a free app to browse, search, and edit those files visually. Think of it as a really nice window into your folder.
3. **An AI tool** (like Claude) that reads and writes inside the folder. It's the engine that builds notes, makes connections, and answers your questions.

That's the whole stack. A folder, a viewer, and an AI engine. They don't just sit next to each other. They feed into each other in a continuous loop. Everything below explains how they fit together.

### The folder and file structure

This is what the vault folder looks like on your computer. It's just a folder with subfolders and text files inside it.

```
My Vault/
├── Map/              ← Basecamps live here. Your topic hubs.
├── Calendar/         ← Daily notes, organized by month and week.
│   └── March/
│       └── Week 1/
│           ├── 2026-03-03.md
│           └── 2026-03-04.md
├── Downloads/        ← Raw inputs and non-text files. Transcripts, PDFs,
│                       images, exports, diagrams, anything to process.
├── Templates/        ← Instructions for AI on how to build notes.
├── CLAUDE.md         ← Your instruction file. AI reads this every session.
├── MEMORY.md         ← Things AI remembers across conversations.
└── [everything else] ← Your notes. All in the root folder, not buried
                        in subfolders. Links do the organizing.
```

#### A few things to know

##### The navigation metaphor

The system borrows its naming from backcountry travel:

- **Map** — The folder that holds all your Basecamps. Your territory overview.
- **Basecamp** — A home base note for a main topic. It provides a high-level overview of whatever the subject is and then also houses links and references to other more detailed notes on the subject. 
- **Compass** — The orientation and summary section at the top of each note. Think of it like a TL;DR that tells you what this note is about, why it's important, and what it connects to.
- **Trails** — Curated links from a Basecamp to the notes that matter most for that topic. The AI can automatically make these connections as you build the system out for yourself.
##### Glossary

A **note** is a single text file. A meeting summary is a note. A project overview is a note. A recipe is a note. Every piece of knowledge in the system is a note. Most notes live in the root of the folder, not buried in subfolders. This is intentional. Instead of deciding "does this go in Work or Personal? Projects or Reference?" you just create the note and let links connect it to everything related.

A **Basecamp** is a special kind of note that acts as a hub for a topic. It doesn't contain everything about that topic. It links to everything about that topic. Your "Work Project" Basecamp links to related meeting summaries, decisions, and people. Think of it as a table of contents for an area of your life. When you need to get up to speed on something, you start at its Basecamp and follow the links. You might have five Basecamps. You might have twenty. They all live in the **Map** folder.

A **daily note** is exactly what it sounds like. A running log of what happened that day, organized by date in the **Calendar** folder. Over time this becomes a searchable journal. "What was I working on the first week of February?" AI knows.

**Downloads** is your inbox. Drop a meeting transcript, a contract, an export from some app. Tell AI to process it. The raw file stays in Downloads. The structured knowledge goes into the vault as notes.

**Templates** are instructions for AI, not forms for you to fill in. The Basecamp template tells AI what sections to create and how to link to existing notes. You say "create a Basecamp for my house renovation" and AI reads the template and builds it. The template is the recipe. AI is the cook.

The result is a web where you can start anywhere and get anywhere. "What did we decide about vendor pricing?" leads to the meeting summary, which links to the project Basecamp, which has the full history. One question, full context. The more notes you add, the denser the web gets. The denser the web, the better AI can trace through it.

**This is a framework, not a rulebook.** Add folders, rename things, create templates that aren't included. Some people will use it as-is. Some will reshape it into something unrecognizable. Both are the right answer.

#### The Instruction File

This is what makes the whole thing work the way it does with AI. There's a file called `CLAUDE.md` that AI reads at the start of every conversation. Now the CLAUDE.md file is obviously specific to Claude but other systems use similar files (we talk about using other AI tools below in Getting Started).

Think of it as a briefing document. If you've used Claude's project instructions or ChatGPT's custom instructions, it's the same idea, except it lives in your folder instead of inside the AI app.

- Here's who I am and what I'm focused on
- Here are my active projects and areas of life I'm tracking
- Here are the people who come up a lot (and how to spell their names)
- Here's how I like my notes formatted
- Here's what to include in a meeting summary and what to leave out
- Here's how I communicate (my tone, my style, what to avoid)

You don't need to fill all of this out before you start. You can start with five lines. "I'm a contracts director at a nonprofit. My main projects are X, Y, Z. I prefer concise summaries over detailed ones." That alone puts you ahead of most AI users because now every conversation starts with context instead of from scratch. Or just start using the system and let AI fill it in over time based on your conversations.

The starter vault comes with this file already built out with tested conventions for daily notes, linking, and more. **It works out of the box.** Here's what it already knows how to do on day one:

- **Morning brief** — Ask "give me a morning brief" and it pulls today's weather, top news, and whatever's active across your life. Sparse on day one. Rich after a few weeks.
- **Daily notes** — It creates them, files them, and keeps them organized. A running log of your day — work, personal, fitness, whatever you tell it about.
- **Processing anything you drop on it** — Meeting transcript, doctor's notes, a recipe you want to save, a contractor's quote, a trip itinerary. Drop it in and tell it what it is. It'll either create the note automatically or ask if you want it to — and suggest whether it should be a daily note entry, a standalone note, or a full Basecamp depending on how substantial it is.
- **Vault search before answering** — Before it responds to any question, it reads your notes. Not guessing. Actually tracing through what you've built and telling you what's there.
- **Activity and fitness log** — Tell it about a workout, a hike, a training block. It knows how to log it in your daily note and build context over time.
- **Voice and drafting** — Fill in the Communication Style section and it drafts messages, emails, and documents that sound like you, not like a template.

That's what's pre-built. Everything else you build over time. When AI does something wrong, add a line to the instruction file: "Don't do X. Do Y instead." When something new becomes active in your life, add it to the Active Projects section. When a name keeps getting mangled, add it to People. The file grows with you. That's how it gets personal.

### Obsidian: your viewer and editor

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a free app that reads the files in your folder and makes them look good and easily readable. Obsidian calls your folder a "vault." It adds clickable links between notes, instant search, a visual graph of how everything connects, and themes to make it yours. Under the hood, it's just reading plain text files. You could delete Obsidian tomorrow and every file would still be there, readable in any text editor.

Obsidian is not an AI tool. It doesn't process anything or talk back to you. It's where you go to read your notes, click through links, and see your knowledge base visually. The AI conversation happens in a separate tool (we cover that in Getting Started). But having both means you always have two paths to the same information: ask AI, or open Obsidian and browse.

You don't have to use Obsidian. Any text editor works since the files are just plain text. But Obsidian handles linking natively, makes everything super easy to find and read, has some great keyboard shortcuts, and even has a really amazing graph view to see how everything you make is connected visually. And it's free. In our opinion, it's the best way to experience what you're building.

### The AI tool: your engine

This is the piece that makes everything feel alive. You open an AI tool, point it at your vault folder, and start chatting. The AI reads your files, writes new ones, builds links between notes, and answers questions using everything you've built. It's the same conversational experience you're used to from ChatGPT or Claude, except now it has your entire knowledge base behind it.

Remember the instruction file from earlier? This is where it really matters. Every conversation starts with context. AI already knows your preferences, your projects, how you write, how you think. The instruction file turns a general-purpose AI into *your* AI.

And because AI is living inside your folder, it can see everything. Not just the note you're working on, but every note, every link, every Basecamp, every trail. When it creates something new, it searches the vault for related content and links to it. That meeting summary connects to the project Basecamp, which connects to the decision log. Over time, the web gets denser and AI has more paths to trace when you ask a question. Each note makes every other note more findable. Each link makes every future question easier to answer. It's not just adding information. It's multiplying the value of what's already there.

The AI tool and Obsidian are separate but connected. They work on the same files, so anything AI creates shows up in Obsidian immediately, and anything you edit in Obsidian is available to AI next time you chat. We cover the specific tools and setup in [Getting Started](#getting-started) below. The short version: we recommend Claude, and the easiest option is called Cowork. It requires a paid account. The system works with any AI tool that can read and write files in a folder.

### Using it is building it

This is where the three pieces stop being a stack and start being a cycle.

You talk to AI. AI creates notes and links them to what's already in your folder. You open Obsidian and see the new notes sitting alongside everything else, connected and searchable. Next time you talk to AI, it has even more context to work with. Which means better answers, better notes, more connections. Which means Obsidian shows you an even richer web. Which means AI has even more to draw from next time. The folder gets richer. Obsidian shows you more. AI gets smarter about your world. Round and round.

That's the part that surprised me most. When you use this system, you're building it at the same time. Brainstorming, processing meetings, drafting documents, thinking out loud. All of these generate notes as a natural byproduct. And then those same notes are what AI searches when you ask questions later. The more you put in, the more useful it gets. Not because the AI improved. Because *your* knowledge base got richer.

Sometimes AI will create notes automatically, like generating a daily note when you give it a meeting transcript. Other times you'll tell it to. "Create a note on what we just talked about." "Add this to my daily note." "Could we make this a Basecamp?" Over time, AI learns to proactively suggest it: "This is getting substantial. Want me to create a note?" The system grows because you're using it, not because you're maintaining it.

## Your Knowledge, Your Files

I know I keep reiterating this but that's only because I think this part the most important part of this whole thing. Everything in this system lives in folders and files on your computer. Plain text. Nothing proprietary, nothing complicated, nothing cloud-locked, nothing that belongs to a specific platform. The AI platform you choose to use reads your files, but your files aren't locked inside the AI platform.

This matters because the AI landscape is moving fast. Your workplace might standardize on ChatGPT this quarter and switch to Claude next quarter. A new tool might launch next month that's better than everything. With this system, you don't rebuild. Your folder is the constant. The AI tool is just what you plug into it today. Your company switches tools? Everything you've built is still right there. You want to try something new? It's all still there. Nothing moves, nothing exports, nothing breaks. Own the playbook, rent the tech.

Now, finally, with all that being said... Let's get you a personal operating system!

---

## Getting Started

Now that you know what you're building and how the pieces fit together, here's how to set it up. The whole thing takes about 20 minutes.

### Step 1: Download Obsidian

Go to [obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) and download it. Free, works on Mac, Windows, Linux, and mobile. This is the app you'll use to browse and edit your vault. (We covered what it does and why we use it in [How It Works](#obsidian-your-viewer-and-editor) above.)

### Step 2: Get the starter vault

Download the starter vault from this [noteOS GitHub repo](https://github.com/BOOMCHOPALAKA/noteOS). Click the green **Code** button at the top of the page and select **Download ZIP**. Unzip it and put the folder somewhere on your computer. It can go anywhere you'd like. Desktop, Documents, your Home folder. Anywhere works great. You can also rename the folder to whatever you want (yournameOS maybe??).

Open Obsidian, select **Open folder as vault**, and point it at the folder you just downloaded. You now have a working vault with:
- **An instruction file** (`CLAUDE.md`) pre-loaded with conventions for meeting processing, daily notes, linking, and more. Works out of the box.
- **A memory file** (`MEMORY.md`) with system-level patterns that AI follows. AI adds to this over time as it learns your preferences.
- **Templates** for daily notes, Basecamps, meeting summaries, and weekly status reports.
- **The folder structure** already set up: Map, Calendar, Downloads, Templates.

### Step 3: Connect your AI tool

This is the part where the magic happens and here's the good news: if you've already used ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, you already know how to do this. You're still typing messages and getting answers in natural language. Nothing about how you interact changes.

The one difference: instead of chatting with AI that can only see what you paste into the conversation, you point it at your vault folder. Now when you ask a question, AI can search through all your notes. When you tell it about a meeting, it can create the summary, file it in the right place, and link it to everything related. When you ask "what did we decide about X last month?" it traces through your notes and gives you a real answer instead of asking you to paste in the context.

Same conversation. Same chat window. But now AI has your entire knowledge base behind it.

**This does require a paid AI account.** The system needs an AI tool that can read and write files directly in a folder on your computer. That's a step beyond what free AI chat tools offer today. The good news is the cost is comparable to a streaming subscription, and the value compounds over time in a way Netflix doesn't.

Right now, the most complete option for non-technical users in our opinion is **Claude** from Anthropic. It's what this system was built and tested with, and it has two tools that both work out of the box:

**Claude Cowork** is the easiest starting point and what most people should use. If you already have the Claude desktop app (or download it from [claude.ai](https://claude.ai)), Cowork is built right in. Here's how to connect it to your vault:

1. Open the Claude desktop app
2. Click the **Cowork** tab at the top (next to "Chat")
3. In the message area, click the **folder icon** and select your vault folder
4. Start typing

That's it. You're now chatting with the same Claude you already know, except it can read and write files in your vault. Create notes, process meeting transcripts, search across everything you've built. It can even handle longer tasks on its own, breaking things into steps and working through them while you do other things. The whole experience is visual and conversational. If you've used ChatGPT or Claude in the browser, this will feel immediately familiar. You just gained superpowers.

Cowork requires a paid Claude subscription (Pro at $20/month, Max at $100/month, or Team/Enterprise). [Getting started with Cowork](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/13345190-get-started-with-cowork)

**Claude Code** is a command-line tool. If you don't know what that means, skip this paragraph and stick with Cowork. You won't miss anything. Claude Code does the same thing as Cowork, just in a terminal window instead of a desktop app. You open a terminal, navigate to your vault folder, and type `claude`. It's a little more powerful and a little more flexible. You get a little more control over how AI interacts with your files, and it's more extensible if you want to customize how the system works under the hood. It's usage-based pricing, meaning you pay for what you use rather than a monthly subscription. If you're technical, curious, or want to grow into it, it's there when you're ready. [Getting started with Claude Code](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview)

**The important thing:** both tools read the same `CLAUDE.md` instruction file, work inside the same vault folder, and produce the same markdown notes. You're not choosing a platform. You're choosing an interface. Everything you build is the same either way, and you can switch between them anytime.

#### What about other AI tools?

This system is designed to be portable. It's just folders and text files. Any AI tool that can read and write files in a local folder will work. That said, the landscape is still evolving. Here's where things stand as of early 2026:

- **OpenAI/ChatGPT** recently launched [ChatGPT agent](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-agent/), which can interact with local apps and create files on your computer. It's getting closer to what Cowork does but works differently. It uses a virtual computer to interact with your apps rather than reading and writing directly in a folder. ChatGPT also has [Codex CLI](https://github.com/openai/codex), a terminal tool with full local file access that reads an `AGENTS.md` instruction file. Available on Plus ($20/month) and up.
- **Google Gemini** has a CLI tool ([Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)) that works similarly to Claude Code. It can read and write local files and supports its own instruction file (`GEMINI.md`). But it's terminal-only. There's no visual desktop equivalent to Cowork yet for non-technical users.
- **Other tools** like Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and Windsurf also support instruction files and local file access, though they're primarily built for software development.

This is moving fast. Any of these providers could ship a Cowork-equivalent tomorrow. When they do, your vault works with them immediately. No migration, no export, no starting over. That's the whole point.

**Using a different AI tool?** The starter vault comes with `CLAUDE.md` because that's what Claude auto-discovers. Just rename or copy the file to match what your tool expects:

| Tool | Instruction file it reads |
|---|---|
| Claude Code / Claude Cowork | `CLAUDE.md` (auto-discovered) |
| GitHub Copilot | `.github/copilot-instructions.md` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` or `AGENTS.md` |
| OpenAI Codex CLI | `AGENTS.md` |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` |
| Windsurf | `.windsurfrules` |

---

## Start Using It

Just start typing. That's genuinely it. You don't need to set up folders or figure out an organizational scheme. Just chat with AI the way you normally would, but now it's building your knowledge base as you go.

Here are some things you can try right out of the gate:

- **"Give me a morning brief."** You can use this on day one. It pulls today's weather, top news headlines, and whatever's active in your vault. On day one that last part is sparse — but as you add meetings, projects, and notes, the brief gets more personal. After a few weeks it's reading your open TODOs, your active projects, what happened yesterday, and what needs attention today. It grows with your vault.
- **"Create a daily note for today. Here's what I worked on..."** and give it a few bullets about your day.
- **"Here's a meeting I had today. Summarize it and add it to my daily note."** Paste in a transcript or your own notes.
- **"Create a Basecamp for [topic]."** A project you're managing, a trip you're planning, a side business you're running.

Start with whatever's on your mind today. The first few notes will feel like scattered dots. But they start connecting fast.

**You're the driver.** The AI can do a lot on its own. Point it at a task and it'll work through it, do research, build out notes, make connections. But it doesn't decide what matters to you. You do. The more intentional you are about directing it, the better the output.

Sometimes it will handle things automatically. It might create a note without being asked, or pause and say "this feels worth saving, want me to create a note?" But when it doesn't, a nudge goes a long way:

- If something feels like it should be a note, say so. "Can we save this as a note?" AI will figure out where it fits and what to link it to.
- If a topic is getting big enough to deserve its own hub, ask. "Should we make a Basecamp for this?"
- If you start a new session and AI seems to not know something you've already captured, point it at the vault. "Yes you do, look through the vault." It'll find it. That nudge takes two seconds and the answer you get back will be more grounded and specific than anything you'd get from a regular chat.

The system grows because you keep using it. You get out of it what you put in. But what you get back is usually better than you expected.

**One thing to know: the system knows what you tell it.** It doesn't connect to your apps or pull data automatically. There's no fitness tracker sync, no calendar integration, no background magic. You give it information, and it remembers and connects it. That's by design. You control exactly what goes in.

In practice, that looks like:

- **Exporting data you already have.** Most apps let you download your own data. Export transactions from your bank, health data from Apple Health, attachments from email. Save those files into the vault's `Downloads/` folder and tell the AI within your vault to look at them.
- **Just telling it about your day.** "I did a 3-mile hike today, felt great, legs weren't as heavy as last week." Type it out, paste stats from an app, or send a screenshot. AI logs it and the context builds over time.
- **Sharing things as they come in.** A meeting transcript, a recipe you tried, a quote from a contractor, notes from a doctor's appointment. Drop it in and tell AI what it is.

After your first conversation, switch over to Obsidian and take a look. The notes are just there. Click on one. See how it's formatted, how it links to other notes. Click a link and you're in another note. That's the Wikipedia layer. A few keyboard shortcuts will make navigating Obsidian feel fast. See the [Obsidian tips and shortcuts](#obsidian-tips-and-shortcuts) section in the Reference below.

You now have two paths to the same information. You can ask AI "what happened yesterday?" and get the answer in the chat. Or you can open Obsidian, navigate to yesterday's daily note, and read through it yourself. Both work. In practice, most of the interaction happens through the chat. But the visual layer is always there when you want to explore, read, or edit on your own.

**This also changes how much you can trust AI's answers.** With a normal chat, you ask "where did you get that?" and the answer is vague. With a vault, the answer becomes "I got this from your March 3rd meeting summary and your pricing strategy note." Specific files. Specific sections. You can click through in Obsidian and see exactly what AI is working from. It doesn't mean AI is always right. But it means you can check its work.

### Once the system has some weight behind it

You stop asking generic questions and start asking things only your vault can answer:

- **"I have a standup in 20 minutes. Catch me up on everything that's happened this week."** It reads your daily notes and recent updates and gives you a briefing.
- **"I'm planning a backpacking trip in August. What gear worked last time and what did I say I'd change?"** It finds your trip notes, your gear lists, that comment you made about your pack being too heavy.
- **"Draft a status report for this week. You know the format."** It does. Because the instruction file has your format, your voice, your conventions.
- **"Here's a meeting transcript. Process it."** It knows what that means. Summarize, extract your action items, update the daily note, link to relevant projects.
- **"When was the dog's last vet appointment and what did they say about her knee?"** It finds the note, the vet's recommendation, the follow-up timeline.

You don't get here on day one. But you get here faster than you'd think.

### Where this goes

To give you a sense of what this looks like after a few months of just using it:

I manage a dev team across two clients. Early on I pointed Claude at our GitHub repos and had it analyze the commit history. Now it knows who built what, who has the deepest expertise in each part of the codebase, and where the knowledge gaps are. When an issue comes up, I can ask "who would be the best person to look at this?" and get a real answer based on actual contribution history.

I also run a small brewing cacao business (shameless plug www.understorycacao.com) on the side. I have a Basecamp for it that links to supplier notes, customer order patterns, pricing strategy, product development ideas. 

I'm also into hiking, backcountry skiing, rucking. I exported my Garmin data into the vault and now whenever I log a workout, AI has years of context behind it. It knows my resting heart rate trends, my training patterns, my peak fitness benchmarks. It tells me things about my own data that Garmin never surfaced.

At work, I have Basecamps for each client with every stakeholder, every project, every decision linked and traceable. When someone mentions a name in a meeting, AI already knows who they are, what they work on, and what they said three weeks ago. I walk into every conversation with context I didn't have to prepare.

I didn't sit down and manually create notes for any of that. It grew from conversations I was having with Claude within Claude Code. None of this was necessarily planned either. I just kept using the system and it built itself around those conversations. That's the magic.

---

## Going Deeper

The basic system works with just notes and an instruction file. How far you go is entirely up to you.

**Start simple:**
- After a meeting or important conversation, tell AI what happened. It creates the note, links it, and organizes it. Or write it yourself in Obsidian. Both work.
- Keep a daily note. A few bullets about what you worked on, what's pending, any decisions made.
- When you make a decision, capture the reasoning. This is gold when you need to reference it later.

**Go deeper when you're ready:**
- Feed it documents from your life. Contracts, proposals, reports, recipes, research. Drop them in Downloads and tell AI to process them.
- Share your writing samples and let it learn your voice. Once it understands how you communicate, it can draft things that sound like you.
- Build out Basecamps with curated links for your most active areas. The more structured your hubs, the better AI navigates between topics.

**Building the habit:**

The value comes from using it consistently. In the first couple weeks, focus on daily notes and telling AI to save things worth remembering. When AI gets something wrong, add a line to your instruction file: "Don't do X. Do Y instead." That's how the system learns your preferences.

After a few weeks, you'll notice topics that keep coming up. Tell AI to create Basecamps for those. Start feeding it documents you reference regularly.

After a month, your instruction file has real depth, your daily notes form a searchable journal, and notes are linking to each other in ways that surface connections you wouldn't have made on your own.

## Reference

### Markdown basics

Markdown is a simple way to format text files. AI writes it for you most of the time, but knowing the basics makes you more effective. You can structure a request with headers and bullets, or tweak something AI created without waiting for it. It takes five minutes:

```
# This is a heading
## This is a smaller heading

**This text is bold**
*This text is italic*

- This is a bullet point
- Another bullet point
  - A nested bullet

[[Link to another note]]
```

`#` for headings (more `#`s = smaller), `**` for bold, `-` for bullets, `[[]]` for links between notes. That's most of what you need.

### FAQ

**What does this cost?**
Obsidian is free. The AI tool is where pricing comes in. Claude Pro ($20/month) or Max ($100/month) gives you access to Claude Cowork. Claude Code is usage-based (you pay for what you use). Other providers have their own pricing. The landscape is evolving fast, so check current pricing when you're ready to start.

**How is this different from other note apps like Notion or Roam?**
Most note apps are about organizing notes. This system is about AI working inside your notes. AI reads your instruction file, processes raw inputs into structured notes, builds the links, and searches across all of it when you ask questions. Traditional note apps give you a place to put things. This gives you a partner that does the putting and the finding.

**Does it have to be Obsidian?**
Not technically. Anything that edits markdown files could work. But Obsidian handles linking natively, has the graph view, and it's free. Everything is still just files. If you ever wanted to switch apps, you take your vault with you.

**How do I know if AI's answers are accurate?**
Ask it to show its work. With a normal chat, "where did you get that?" gives you a vague answer. With a vault, AI points to specific notes and sections. You can open them in Obsidian and verify. It's not a guarantee of accuracy, but it's a level of transparency you don't get from a regular chat window.

**How long before it starts feeling useful?**
A few days if you commit to daily notes and the instruction file. A few weeks before the linking and compounding really kicks in. The first time you ask AI a question about something you noted three weeks ago and it gives you a perfect answer with full context, you'll get it.

**I barely use AI now. Is this overkill?**
Maybe. If you're happy with how you manage your information, you don't need this. But if you've ever thought "I know I wrote this down somewhere" or "I spend too much time getting AI up to speed on my situation," this is the fix.

**What about privacy? Is my data safe?**
A few things to understand here. Your vault files live on your computer. Only you and anyone with access to your machine can see them. AI doesn't permanently store your entire vault somewhere.

But when you type something into Cowork or Code, that message goes to the AI provider's servers for processing. This is true of every AI chat tool, not just this system. So if you paste a contract into Claude, Claude's servers process it to generate a response.

What happens with that data depends on your plan. On personal plans (Claude Free, Pro, Max), your conversations can be used to improve AI models unless you opt out in your privacy settings. On business plans (Team, Enterprise), your data is not used for training. Period.

If you work somewhere with an AI policy, that policy is your guide. This system doesn't change what your company allows you to share with AI tools. Some people mask sensitive details before sharing them. "Summarize this contract but replace all names with Donor X." Others keep sensitive material out of the vault entirely and only use it for non-confidential work. Both approaches work fine. The system is useful at any level of openness.

You can also tell AI to anonymize information in the notes it saves. The raw input still went to the server for processing, but your local files stay clean. This is useful if you're concerned about someone seeing your vault on your computer.

Start with what feels safe. Expand when and if you're comfortable.

### The graph view

One of Obsidian's best features. It shows your entire vault as a visual network. Every note is a dot, every link is a line between them. You can watch your knowledge base grow from a handful of scattered dots into a dense, interconnected web. It's not just eye candy. It's a real way to spot clusters, find orphan notes, and see which topics are most central to your thinking.

### Obsidian tips and shortcuts

You don't need to memorize any of this to get started. But once you're using the vault regularly, a few shortcuts make everything faster. These are the ones that matter most.

**Finding things fast:**

| Action | Mac | Windows/Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Quick switcher (jump to any note by name) | Cmd+O | Ctrl+O |
| Command palette (search for any action) | Cmd+P | Ctrl+P |
| Search across all notes | Shift+Cmd+F | Ctrl+Shift+F |
| Search within current note | Cmd+F | Ctrl+F |

The **quick switcher** is the one to learn first. Start typing a note name and it finds it instantly. You'll use this more than anything else in Obsidian.

The **command palette** is the Swiss army knife. If you're not sure how to do something, open it and start typing. "Graph", "daily", "template", whatever. It searches every available action.

**Editing and navigating:**

| Action | Mac | Windows/Linux |
|---|---|---|
| Create new note | Cmd+N | Ctrl+N |
| Toggle bold | Cmd+B | Ctrl+B |
| Toggle italic | Cmd+I | Ctrl+I |
| Insert link | Cmd+K | Ctrl+K |
| Toggle edit/reading view | Cmd+E | Ctrl+E |
| Open graph view | Cmd+G | Ctrl+G |
| Go back (like a browser) | Alt+Cmd+Left | Ctrl+Alt+Left |
| Go forward | Alt+Cmd+Right | Ctrl+Alt+Right |

**Linking tip:** To link to another note while typing, just type `[[` and start typing the note name. Obsidian autocompletes it for you. This is faster than the insert link shortcut for wiki links.

**Other things worth knowing:**
- You can customize any shortcut in Settings > Hotkeys
- Clicking a link while holding Cmd (Mac) or Ctrl (Windows) opens the note in a new pane, so you can see both notes side by side
- Star/bookmark notes you reference often so they're always one click away in the sidebar
