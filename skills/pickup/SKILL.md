# Pickup

**When this skill triggers, start your response with:** `Using pickup skill`

## Overview

Resume a previous session. Read what was saved, load the relevant context, and orient the user on where things stand so they can keep going without re-explaining.

## Workflow

### 1. Read Current Context

Start with Current Context (or whatever cross-session whiteboard the vault uses). This has the active threads, where things left off, and what needs attention. Note which threads have the most recent dates and which files are linked.

### 2. Read the Latest Chat Log Entry

Open the Chat Log and read the most recent entry. This has:
- **Topics:** What was covered
- **What got persisted:** Which files were updated
- **Key context:** The thinking, connections, and unresolved items that are hardest to reconstruct

The Chat Log entry often has nuance that Current Context doesn't. Decisions that were discussed but not finalized. Patterns that were noticed. Things that felt off.

### 3. Read the Linked Files

Based on what Current Context and the Chat Log point to, read the specific sections that matter:
- Daily note entries referenced (use section anchors)
- Project notes that were updated
- Analysis docs or knowledge notes that were created/modified
- Anything in "Open For Next Session" or equivalent

Don't read everything in the vault. Read what the breadcrumbs point to.

### 4. Orient

Give a concise briefing:

**Where we left off:** 2-3 sentences. What was the last session about, what was the last thing discussed or decided.

**What's ready to pick up:** Bulleted list of threads that have clear next steps. Lead with the most actionable ones.

**What's waiting on others:** Anything blocked on someone else. Quick status if known.

**What needs attention:** Items from "Open For Next Session" that look time-sensitive or stale.

Keep it tight. This is a launchpad, not a report.

### 5. Bridge

Close with: **"Where would you like to pick up from?"** followed by 2-4 natural language options drawn from the active threads. These aren't just topic labels. Frame them as continuations of a conversation:

- "We were looking into the performance issue. Want to plan next steps with the hosting provider?"
- "The product launch is next week. Want to check where the team is on the remaining items?"
- "You mentioned wanting to draft that follow-up email. Want to work on that?"

Lead with the thread that feels most urgent or time-sensitive. Make it easy to just say "yeah, let's do the first one" and go.

## Hard Rules

- **Don't summarize the entire vault.** Only surface what's relevant from the last session and active threads.
- **Don't guess at state.** If Current Context says "waiting on someone" and you don't know if they delivered, say "last known: waiting on [person]." Don't assume.
- **Read before orienting.** Don't produce the briefing from memory alone. Actually read Current Context, Chat Log, and linked files.
- **Be brief.** The whole point is to get back into flow fast. If the orient section is more than a screen, it's too long.
- **If there's nothing to pick up** (empty Current Context, no recent Chat Log entries), say so. Don't manufacture context.
